# Notes from Playtesting

## Bugs
- [ ] Bombs should not be heal-able (maybe there is some 'repair/mending' skill for inanimate objects though)
- [ ] Weird interaction with absorption (temp Hp) and trap descriptions [it was saying the _trap_ absorbed damage?]
- [ ] Traps with planeshift effects don't seem to work

## Features
- [ ] Make effective weapon/armor/size work for shapechange
- [ ] Make read thoughts telegraph next moves (we may have to _obscure_ compelled moves like charge first?)
- [ ] Make criticalRangeIncrease work
- [ ] Flight should make you actually _untargetable_ by melee
- [ ] Show current gold before purchasing potions
- [ ] Remind players to rest if they're not at full health going into boss battle
- [ ] Unify search/examine (should both have chance to find potions/loot and both grant XP on success)
- [ ] All mage schools should have enough low-level spells to pick from
- [ ] Traps should remember if they've been triggered (ie if you return to the dungeon again)
- [ ] Rooms should remember in general if you've searched/examined things 

## Ideas
- [ ] Rest could reset status effects? (would be nice to do this _before_ persisting PCs?)
- [ ] Healing potion could cure poison status too? [maybe better to have a dedicated consumable for it though]
- [ ] Poisoned blade still has weird expiration message actually? ("X is no longer poisoned blade"; a bit awkward to fix since a standard message would be ideal here)
- [ ] A cage could have a chance to have a prisoner (who could become ally); incidentally would be nice for it to be more likely within a 'cell' room
- ---
- [ ] Larger rooms could give more search opps?
- ---
- [ ] Temple blessing should _recharge_ duration if already present (ie just having the blessing should not necessarily disable prayer)
- [ ] Would be interesting to distinguish between positive/negative effects (maybe rest should cure only bad things?)
- [ ] We don't seem to redisplay room details if you've levelled up?
- [ ] Maybe taking damage makes enemies more likely to defend?
- [ ] Examining maps/atlases could have a chance to give dungeon clues? (ie clues to _other_ dungeons)
- [ ] Should at least be a _chance_ for AI to pick on someone other than weakest enemy
- ---
- [ ] Better adventure module names (not just quest/saga/adventure of the $terrain...)
- [ ] Should only be able to visit temple _once_ per long rest/visit in town
- [ ] Found "letter" and "wanted poster" items could have clues about the dungeon boss (if not other bosses etc) [wanted poster could have pictures of your party!]
- ---
- [ ] Poison damage should indicate who _inflicted_ it (this is sort of tracked but not surfaced...)
- ---
- [ ] Should reset abilities used on long rest? (why isn't this happening -- is this still happening at all?)
- [ ] It would be nice to able to explore more freely (move back to previous rooms?)
- [ ] Show party status before asking to rest
- [ ] Losing a wandering monster battle should not leave you in the room waiting to decide what to do!
- [ ] You should be able to visit the Inn even if at full HP?
- ---
- ---
- [ ] Show full enemy name more often (we often default to just the forename ie 'minimal' combatant view with forename + HP but this is ... not very much information)
- ---
- [ ] They should also have a chance to flee 'involuntarily' if they fail a save vs fear? (don't necessarily want to model 'splitting the party' but ... they could find individually-flown characters in previous rooms of the dungeon?)
- [ ] Some statuses still sound weird ("[defender] is Chaos by [inflicter]" - odd)
- ---
- [ ] AI should not use buffs that only target allies if all allies are dead
- [ ] Dungeons with multiple floors (levels in principle seem relatively straightforward but we'd need to adapt dungeoneer to handle them...)
- ---
- [ ] Wildnerness: Collect herbs, hear birdcalls (at least when not winter? but there are winter birds aren't there?)
- ---
- [ ] Track playerAligned as _well_ as playerControlled (sort of captured by being on the team of the player but this isn't passed along with combatant in all cases... -- we can always check for allegiance effects but a little subtle i guess?)
- ---
- [ ] Would be nice to let _all_ PCs attempt to interact/examine/search (as opposed to one and done for the action)
- [ ] Maybe charm is dispelled if the charmer dies??
- ---
- [ ] Would be nice to have more narrow utilty-cleric abilities (neutralize poison, remove paralysis, ultimately a high-level 'heal' which fixes status effects AND brings health back...)
- [ ] Should permit player to _leave_ the dungeon (they _can_ but would have to flee and even that's disabled now, maybe to focus autoplay -- but anyway seems to be entirely disabled in fact rn)
- ---
- [ ] Dirty trick should not give a save vs magic? (maybe vs will or even specifically vs blinding?)
- [ ] Should say 'leave the dungeon' instead of 'move to next room' for last room
- ---
- [ ] Summon creature should display a _little_ more information about the summon than the forename (type/class at least)
- [ ] Armorer should only let you give weapons for humanoids to wield
- [ ] Weapon proficiencies should matter for equipping PCs (ie not letting mage have huge battleaxes)
- ---
- [ ] Offer to equip wearables if you find them in loot (give wearables/consumables in room treasure -- may need some tracking for 'unworn wearables'... -- don't think we give them out yet but a lot of the loot items are _suggestive_ of wearables or magic weapons/armor) 
- [ ] Animals should not have _blur_ spell
- [ ] Treasure that is just coins should just be gp (we could give platinum/copper/silver for variety but fine if not!!)
- [ ] Should your own summoned creatures be able to flee?? (presumably henchmen can flee if morale drops too low but we don't have henches proper yet)
- ---
- [ ] Acid should degrade armor/weapons...
- [ ] Traps/lockpicking [we have traps but no locks to pick yet, maybe it doesn't make sense until we have topology/direction choices and can block the shortest path though]
- [ ] Double-check that initial weapon loadouts match proficiencies
- [ ] Restrict consumable purchases if no one in the party is proficient at all with it
- ---
- [ ] Should silence disable wands/scrolls??? [it seems to disable (at least certain) wands but _not_ (at least certain) scrolls right now?]
- [ ] Show cooldown (at least indicators) as part of ability text/description
- [ ] Could ask if you want to use healing spells on short rest
- [ ] Autoplay doesn't seem to preserve character levels between modules??
- ---
- [ ] Display healing item names used during rest
- [ ] NPCs with wildtype aspect shouldn't have that as part of their name
- [ ] AI heuristic scoring for disable devices (AI thieves should favor disable if there's a non-disabled device etc)
- [ ] Show mechanical descriptions of all statuses/auras/traits (not just flavor)
- [ ] Impose max summons cap for wizards (1 at level 1, growing slowly; slots for: familiar, animal, monsters) [implemented at 1 but should implement growing logic]
- [ ] Summon undead doesn't seem to summon appropriate races for the given dungeon
- [ ] A dispelling buffer (for _arcane ward_) that counters up to a certain number of offensive spells cast on you
- [ ] Morale/loyalty for hirelings?
---
- [ ] Better verbs for wand/stave actions (not 'performs', maybe 'use')
---
- [ ] Arbitrary scrolls/wands for every effect [technically enabled now with 'cast' effect but needs some thinking about how to implement -- I guess we could have a scroll/wand generator?]
- [ ] mapLookup (to reify more things at gen time)
---
- [ ] Pick a single pantheon for deities?
- [ ] Maybe deific blessings _don't_ expire but you can only have one?
---
- [ ] Maybe fire damage reduces bomb ticking countdown??
- [ ] More terrains (island, jungle, volcano...)
- [ ] Set environment to urban when in town hub (and have some investigate/examine/search opps somehow?)
- [ ] Make shrine feature blessings into real shrine blessings and give more distinctive room features? (ie not pseudo-'shrines')
- [ ] Maybe restrict to one divine blessing at a time (and have them not timeout/tickdown ie a divine passive?)
---
- [ ] Tiny game db with towns you've visited so you can travel back
---
- [ ] Racial magic weapon/armor traits (sword of goblinkind with abilities we can lookup)
- [ ] Dual terrain types
- [ ] Model PC classes as a table; race job restrictions as data
- [ ] Climate as list of weather types (randomized each day)
---
- [ ] Calendar with special month names? (Presumably there's no roman calendar in the prime material plane of a fantasy world?)
- [ ] Would be intersting to somehow model 'caster' as a trait ('casts:divine', 'casts:arcane', maybe 'casts:shadow' for evil-aligned spells? ie just throw the book at them and let them work out what makes sense to use. ideally there's symmetry with the pcs though)
---
- [ ] Could call victory if all enemies petrified/asleep/mazed?
---
---
- [ ] Handle 'defeated' barks more gracefully ('X has defeated X', and then they have a triumphant bark! [Which is wrong/immersion breaking])
- [ ] Handle mutual TPK more gracefully (currently displays both "You are victorious!" and "Your party has been defeated")
---
- [ ] Should display _what_ healing items were used on rest
- [ ] Divine blessings should be (specially-marked) passives? Maybe restrict to one at a time?
- [ ] Staying at the inn should cost gold
- [ ] Hearing a rumor should cost ~1-2 gp (to buy drinks?)
- [ ] Maybe simple town quests to generate small gp amounts (go to this building, deliver this message, clear the basement of rats, find a patron at the bar etc?) 
- [ ] Mages could pick a school?
- [ ] Riddles should give actual loot/gear and let you equip them??
- [ ] More puzzle types than just riddles???
- [ ] Demons/devil split (with home planes of abyss/pandemonium vs cthell/hades)
- [ ] Could use a planeshift-like in combat to target _enemies_ (ie true removal) but maybe also have lower-order _banishment_ which sends away any enemy creatures with a different home plane?
- [ ] Generate static list of tavern hirelings each day
- [ ] Wonders should have _strictly better_ boons than normal room features!
- [ ] Purge active fx on long rest
---
- [ ] Group riddle answers by type so they're marginally more challenging?
- [ ] Confused players (randomActions) should _also_ pick targets at random!!!
- [ ] Teleport might be not working? (it said 'go to random room' and I _guess_ it could have selected the same room but -- need more debugging here)
- [ ] Sell all junk option at general store
---
- [ ] Throwable aspect on weapons like javelin, spear (simple dual use as melee/ranged -- but maybe you need a 'retrieve' action after ranged, although possibly too involved?)
- [ ] Town suffixes linked to terrain type / town adjectives linked to pop size
- [ ] More flavor on shops (inn and tavern should have an interesting name etc)
---
- [ ] Make sure inanimate things like barrier/antimagic ward have some action they can take (or at least a response to common actions) 
- [ ] Legendary armor sets
- [ ] Campaign-global unique items
---
- [ ] Unify weapon/armor/item instance interfaces somehow
- [ ] Mages can _summon familiar_ to get an animal companion appropriate for their racial group but also with the typical familiar benefits (ie it's always the same familiar, it can level up with you etc)
---
- [ ] Would be interesting to restrict domain/school by _race_ too (only gnome illusionists etc)
- [ ] Inn should not heal the dead (need temple rez)
- [ ] Extraneous period in item description on acquisition ('Found some nice gloves. in the secret stash.')
- [ ] Maybe you should be able to use consumables between rooms / cast noncombat spells + buffs
- [ ] Could autocast healing spells on stabilize also
- [ ] Trap rate seems _really_ high (like every examine item is trapped?)
- [ ] Barriers/walls should not have 'fists' (maybe 'impact')
- [ ] Damage type effects (ie infected status trigger on bleed) should not trigger on 0 damage events
- [ ] You could attempt stabilization of less-than-zero hp members at the Inn (and have to rez at temple if failed) -- ie this already is what happens on short rest in the dungeon (and if it fails you have to rez)
- [ ] Rez even at temple should have a chance to fail
- [ ] Can't equip multiple rings from the shop anymore? (They all go to a 'ring' slot and don't differentiate 'ring1', 'ring2')
- [ ] Should only offer to equip found items if you're proficient in them
---
- [ ] Really make sure default loadout only gives armor/weapons users are proficient in
- [ ] Nat 1 on examine riddle should prevent further inspection (could 'break' the puzzle box/make glyphs disappear etc)
---
- [ ] Offer to rez before asking for blessing donations (temple flow)
- [ ] Restrict hard/lethal riddles to later dungeons (or lower DC overall)
- [ ] Docbooks/ability description could now distinguish between buffs/conditions?

## Fixed
- [x] Temple/shrine to local deity to get a blessing
- [x] Healers healing themselves should say "X heals" not "X heals X"
- [x] Healers should not heal when already at full HP
- [x] Show current HP at start of round? Maybe each turn (we show on each turn now)
- [x] Scale dungeon CR by level of party
- [x] Magic missile sometimes seems fatal even when it deals less than total HP damage (not vs bosses??)
- [x] Creatures that fall unconscious from poison should _not_ then attack!
- [x] Is charge damage being applied correctly at all??? [it wasn't!]
- [x] It still seems like npcs are dying at 1 HP somehow? But hard to pin down somehow [poison double damage...]
- [x] Room names should not have underscores (throne_room) when presented to the player
- [x] Should only be able to inspire if you have conscious allies
- [x] Fear message should be clarified: "X is frightened" not "X is too frightened to act" since it may not be their turn at all (ie fear event isn't only used on failed flee anymore) [now just 'X is frightened']
- [x] Finding rusted/silver/golden coins should grant XP bonus
- [x] Make 'wait' the _last_ option in the action list... (adjusted hardcoded starting ability list but could be better!)
- [x] Offer to take party to new dungeon if they beat it [sort of done with module gen]
- [x] Only thieves/bandits/assassins should get daggers? (They're very strong with multiple attack die?) [only 1 attack die for daggers now]
- [x] A "successfully resisted (effect)" message would be clarifying too (done)
- [x] Effects could stack more nicely (we don't need 'poisoned' twice?) -- now deduped
- [x] Abilities even for npcs should be limited by spell slots (seemingly done?)
- [x] Is poison damage even being applied?? (I think it is???)
- [x] Bring back 'flee'/battle escape abilities (enemies should be able to if they pass the dc check)
- [x] Rolls should always indicate what die you are rolling... (i think this should be true now)
- [x] Effect expiry say "no longer X" if you're still X from another version of the same effect (maybe more about stacking/aggregating effects properly) (effects should dedupe now)
- [x] Make sure gold accumulated in dungeons is available in town (it is!)
- [x] Special abilities should be rarer (thief shouldn't have poison cloud, _maybe_ assassin does) (think this should be true now)
- [x] Maybe you have to consume potions to heal? (Or use cleric abilities...?) (should be limited to this now!)
- [x] Maybe the PC hp curve should be flattened a bit too? (50 HP at level 5 seems like a lot??) (now follows normal hit die flow on level up...)
- [x] Reset 'used abilities' list for PCs between battles so they can charge more than once!! (this should be happening now!)
- [x] Charge ability for player warriors? Some buff/bless ability for clerics?? (implemented charge for warriors, bless for clerics)
- [x] Enemies should have spell slots/dwindling resources (poison capsule could be a consumable for them -- can't just throw capsules all day!) (should now have slots and abilitiesUsed tracker...)
- [x] Colorize stats consistently (ie when search/examine we should see the appropriate color for int/wis as in the statline rainbow) (done for search/examine!)
- [x] Should be able to go back to a dungeon you _haven't_ completed yet... (think this is true now)
- [x] Set limit on saves vs death (3 per combat?)
- [x] Process traits for enemy npcs (undead should get benefits like immune charm/sleep/poison?)
- [x] Maybe you can leave an offering (5gp) at a (dungeon) shrine for a blessing?
- [x] Loot should be accumulated ("X takes it" = added to a list on their pc record)
- [x] CR scaling still not working great for deeper rooms? (seems to be vaguely more reasonable now but also we've kind of nerfed CR checks by _only_ checking NPCs when there are also true monsters and animal companions now -- we can constrain-gen them independently but seems subtle too somehow) -- should be fixed with top-down/exact CR gen
- [x] Target CR for the dungeon was 4 but first three rooms all had CR 3?? -- should be fixed with exact CR budgeting
- [x] CR levels still seem _very_ high for bosses (but maybe more about how the CR scales in progression over the dungeon; that said we also add "+1" to the target + depth so maybe could remove that?) -- should be fixed with exact CR budgeting
- [x] We could also spell out DC checks and bonuses for now (just to sanity check) as well as bonus damage/healing in general - think this is mostly true
- [x] Smite scaling 2d6 * level is way too powerful at higher levels (adjusted a bit) -- should be marginally better (but radiant damage against vulnerable enemies still _very_ strong!)
- [x] 20 should be stat max until level 10 (maybe 18 until level 5...) -- currently set to max out at 18 until level 20
- [x] range vs melee action is good flavor but -- should take account of current weapon! bows shouldn't melee etc (have 'fixed' by adjusting starting equipment but should be a deeper solution) -- think this is done by str/dex split and deriving range/melee ability _from_ the primary weapon
- [x] Adjust status durations check so that they expire at end of _turn_ not _round_? (think this should be done!)
- [x] Aggregate lists of features since it's possible to get _two_ polluted fountains (should be unique now but could try to confirm in play)
- [x] Humanize room names on describe room (this ought to be done?)
- [x] Creatures could escape _before_ the round starts (so they don't display in party listing)
- [x] Enemy saves should at least be presented clearly (okay for this to be '...but nothing happened' but ideal to say 'x made their save!' or similar -- should display 'resisted effect' now...)
- [x] Roundhouse too strong (nerfed a lot now but still) -- very nerfed now, but whirlwind is very strong too (not completely sure how to adjust since it's "just" an AoE attack with your primary weapon)
- [x] Spawn appropriate gear for PCs (spellbooks for mages, holy symbols for clerics, lockpicking tool for thieves -- think this is roughly done but could be improved)
- [x] Death priest has type 'undead' rather than dungeon race? (fixed -- also made sure we _definitely_ get special room npc types)
- [x] "Veteran Novice" sounds strange (maybe Novice -> Initiate?) [now hiding all non-veteran+ ranks]
- [x] Should not rez with 0 HP (should be fixed now i think)
- [x] Show detailed breakdown of dungeons/rooms/actual vs effect CR (maybe separate spec for module runner?)
- [x] Lowest rank should be something besides 'untested' (maybe 'minion' is fine? Ideally it's just 'unranked' and no special display however!) -- the pre-veteran ranks don't display but there's now untested/rookie/seargeant/captain
- [x] Enemy AC seems _really_ low -- a character with high dex is always getting 0 or less to hit! (maybe fixed by giving them armor?) -- think we've resolved this more or less
- [x] High-level enemies should have much higher dex (tried to adjust although maybe _too_ high now?) -- again maybe fixed now
- [x] Need money sinks + some other consumable besides potion (again maybe adventuring kits power first aid) -- added more consumables/weapon store/money sinks
- [x] Display full statline in town + current effects (added show current party details option)
- [x] AC still seems really low for monsters (maybe should go back to displaying it and thac0/to-hit bonuses just to sanity-check the math even if it's very noisy) -- think it's okay but we could bring the display back for testing
- [x] Align npc occupations with dungeon type ... (done!)
- [x] Show nicer character record with details/descriptions about traits
- [x] Show sources of passive/trait-based effects (awkward since we erase when we coalesce fx!) -- we do this at least in narrow cases of statuses changing resistance/vulnerability now!
- [x] Healing should never present more HP than the character has lost (incidentally there should be a 'handleHeal' command so we're always processing it consistently) -- think this is done
- [x] Should be able to see what active effects you have even in town
- [x] Successful resistance should give a message ("successfully resisted...") -- think this is true now
- [x] A spell that causes stun could be interesting (flesh-to-stone would be neat too?) -- i think shocking grasp has a chance to do this
- [x] Gold flow is a mess, 40k after _losing_ to the first dungeon??? (think this was about outsized rewards for special rooms)
- [x] "Heal 1 every successful hit" is too powerful ('vitalist' trait shared by all elves -- and note elves already get multiple very powerful passives?) -- no longer applied at start, have to level into it
- [x] Heal ally is selecting dead PCs as valid targets (should only be standing _and_ wounded PCs) -- maybe resolved with fixes to targeting
- [x] Wand charges -- think these are working roughly
- [x] Unconscious allies maybe shouldn't get XP? -- tried to do this but not sure it's actually what we want somehow
- [x] effectiveStats helper really needs to consider passives (and now equipment!) -- should be happening now
- [x] Somehow a lich took damage 5 separate times from being a marked target??? (on a normal melee attack) -- fixed loop
- [x] Statuses like 'defending' really need to expire at end of next _turn_ not end of _round_
- [x] Humanize weapon names in damage description ("takes 5 damage from Valen's light_mace" => "Light Mace", maybe add damage type here?)
- [x] Why does paralyze have 'unknown' duration?? (from an enemy's paralyzing_touch) -- should be fixed!
- [x] A room generated with multiple monsters with the same name (humans may need more names as a race but also maybe we could _specifically_ try to prevent this?) [genList would need a dedupe pass to really be _certain_ of this] -- Duplicate forenames still problematic -- maybe 'forename' can just _be_ magical within deem (genList could identify and toss dupes to prevent issues like this -- may cause other problems and seems weird... adding some gross genUniqListByKey seems 'too heavy' too; or we could have a 'gather' function that grabs all values of the __items but the expression then just gets too gnarly; note technically it's not even the 'name' key but 'forename' which ... we could just have a much deeper list to draw from to prevent this happening so often but that doesn't really solve this fundamentally!) -- genList/mapGenList could handle this by adding index #s but maybe not ideal somehow [note: pc and npc forenames are globally unique now and we actually throw a hard error on repeat just to help us see what's shallow in terms of naming pool -- but can fallback to resetting options list ... should help a lot if not _completely_ solve this]
- [x] Should you roll your own poison damage? Feels strange -- maybe should just be automatic? -- most rolls are elided in output now anyway!
- [x] Unconscious characters should not roll init - I think fixed but also not initiative rolls aren't surfaced anymore
- [x] Defend doesn't last long enough? Any effect with a duration of 1 only lasts until the end of the _current_ round (we moved to the end of the round for the check instead of individual turn beginning for clarity but maybe clearer to have co-located in flow with the individual combatant turn) - statuses should now tick down on combatant turn 
- [x] Need save events (system-level SaveEvent propagated upward by save command handler to represent succeeding or failing a save roll) - this is implemented
- [x] Would be nice to write logs to a file for easier copy-paste
- [x] Ring of regen probably not working since we don't have turnStart event fx handling? -- moved to turnEnd but still need to test
- [x] Restrict wands to caster classes (and clerics can only use healing ones) - should be done!
- [x] Maybe only mages can use wands/scrolls?? -- should be done
- [x] Reduce consumable treasure-drop rate (90% is way too high!!) and maybe try to govern the tier of loot found (should not find scrolls of apocalypse/powerful wands everywhere!)
- [x] Equipment from shop attaching to 'unknown' slot? -- maybe fixed now?
- [x] Monster manual output
- [x] Make `randomActions` effect from confuse work!!
- [x] Skeletons should be immune to piercing damage
- [x] Would be nice to see literal HP for your party (ie not just approximate bar)
- [x] Disable summon abilities if you already have 6 allied creatures (alive or dead...) / Shouldn't be able to call animal companion if 6 allies present! (standing or not)
- [x] Effects from shrine not getting applied to characters? (maybe getting erased at Combat#setUp if configured as activeEffect but also I don't think I was even seeing it immediately on the character rec at all?) -- this was about activeEffects getting cleared [should be fixed now]
- [x] If you don't have enough to buy the quantity you like it should not say "You purchase X" (even if the next line is saying "not enough gold") -- should be fixed
- [x] Temple blessings should take account of the deity somehow... (war gods give toHit, love goddess grants chance to charm on hit etc)
- [x] Some kind of temp hp/buffer for glass cannons
- [x] Are we adding stat bonuses to save checks? (Probably not but maybe we should in at least some cases?) -- yes!
- [x] Adventuring kit could be a consumable that is needed to give first aid? - just 'first aid kit' but this exists now!
- [x] Might be good/wise/prudent to gather status effects into constants so we're not subject to (as many) typo bugs! (more generally it would be nice to have a statuses.json for defining common effects like poisoning uniformly...)
- [x] Hidden seems to be removed whenever the hiding creature _gets_ attacked (should be removed whenever the hiding creature itself _attacks_)
- [x] Zero handling
  - [x] Was seeing 0-damage attacks on elite units (maybe something to do with DR but a 0-damage attack is a miss, although we could gloss as 'graze' or something?)
  - [x] Healing for 0 HP should be presented as a failure (not "heals for 0 damage" but "tried to heal but fails") -- thought we had repaired this but still seeing 0-amount heals -- we'd need to elide these events (for turn-end regen effects I think but maybe other places)
  - [x] Magic missile that does 0 damage should be glossed as a miss I think? (even though they're supposed to have 'perfect' targeting!)
- [x] Spell reflection/turning
- [x] Caster enemies should be limited to spell pools appropriate to their level
- [x] Smokescreen should hide the caster too! (Maybe we need a 'party' target?)
- [x] Elemental template (iterate through each element for MM)
- [x] Template overlay for dungeon types (could express '30% undead' outside of deem template...)
- [x] Why is save vs Bleed a will check? Seems weird? -- added save vs bleed (though it could just be fort check)
- [x] Why is a wolf casting earthquake??? (presumably it was 'Giant' wolf but maybe just give a 'stomp' AoE ability?) -- think this should be resolved by having adjusted ability lists
- [x] Preprocess equipment at combat start so _ring of true seeing_ can be implemented -- done I think!
- [x] _plane shift_ should work from within combat
- [x] Cast effect type (for metamagic + spell-like abilities, but should also enable fully general scrolls/wands/potions)
- [x] Maybe you need a clue to travel to a dungeon?? -- have to at least hear rumor now
- [x] Something weird with gold -- they have it in town but don't in the dungeon??? -- think this _should_ be fixed but need to validate!
- [x] Make sure we always go through handleReactions flow so _time stop_ can guarantee `triggerReactions: false` effect works -- think this is the case!
- [x] Player party _must_ be able to attempt to flee a battle intentionally (could be a dex skill check?)
- [x] Bomb shouldn't be able to reset ticking status! [tried to adjust this]
- [x] Confirm that room sequences are being adhered to?? [seems to be the case now]
- [x] Could use a `loot` table for generic but saleable items? (If only to give them descriptions/stable values anyway -- done, junk table)
- [x] Gold still getting zeroed out at dungeon entry/not distributed somehow? (maybe fixed??)
- [x] Phylactery summoned a lich but we were able to finish the combat without defeating it??? (should be solved)
- [x] Found treasure/gems should be redeemable for gold [should be true with general store now?]
- [x] Make sure we can use wands??? (wand_of_polymorph not coming up in use item options)
- [x] Magic weapons/armor (ie unify equipment w/ armor/weapons)
- [x] Special effect type for 'cast' (ie to make scrolls simpler to implement/less duplicative) -- think this is done
- [x] There should be a shop to sell treasure (maybe also buy other kinds of consumables?) -- general store!
- [x] Resting somehow advances us into the next room? (thought this was wandering monster but definitely a new room) -- think this was just a flow issue
- [x] "General store" to purchase gear, jeweler to purchase gems [jeweler in place but need to test!]
- [x] Staff/quarterstaff may not be listed in armory for some reason? [it's there...?]
- [x] Remove auras at end of combat [should be done i think?]
- [x] Bombs should not be melee attacking! [added 'mayNotPrimary' kind of status mod to inanimate creatures but maybe a better way to do this?]
- [x] Make _heavy handed_ feat actually improve proficiency with heavy weapons _only_ (done!)
- [x] Polymorph effect -- seems to roughly work, but should enforce some enforce ability limitations (effectiveAbilities) -- should be true now!
- [x] Generator/template for gems/high-order treasure [gem done anyway but treasure could use some love still] -- see loot generator!
- [x] All loot is meaningful (either wearable, consumable or saleable at some general store in town) -- should be true now
- [x] Restrict casters from heavy armor (armorProficiencies by class)
- [x] Template for dragons
- [x] Blacksmith who can give a +1 to weapons?
- [x] Describe colors of prismatic spray/multiplicity cards (done for normal damage fx, but spell beams don't hint their description clearly)
- [x] Bring back status displays on the per turn overview... (we currently have per-round overview) -- now per turn displayed
- [x] Seems fixed but really make sure we're handling gold transition between town hub/dungeon correctly -- think this is okay now??
- [x] Hirelings should get starting gear (should be working!)
- [x] An _extra_ lich got summoned by _black ritual_...? (Something weird with tickdown?) -- should be fixed now

## Not really issues atm
- Load all PCs on party select so we can show their race/class (no longer even letting you load PCs from file but we're still persisting them every room...) (we don't even persist PC records anymore)
