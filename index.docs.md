## Backstory

#### The World
The planet of Imbar was formed uncountable years ago...

It is a world marked by innumerable wonders, for the powerful magic which binds together the souls and bodies of mortals, the prima materium, may be manipulated by those skilled in the art...

Yet there are other worlds, formed out of the darkness and void, whose memory goes back far beyond that of Imbar; innumerable distinct realities, as close to us as a hair's width yet immensely difficult to access.

Thus is the world marked by portals that join planes of existence that are otherwise nearly impossible to traverse by flesh unaided...

The wise believe the planes were forged in a profound cosmological cataclysm. Good and evil deities struggling for control of how the planet would be shaped. The world was nearly un-made before it was full-wrought... but then, from beyond the halls of existence, a new order, known by the wise as the Virina, the High Arbiters of Imbar, was sent by the Allfather, and they came down into the world, and they brokered an uneasy peace between the warring angels and demons; and by separating the planes, each faction could sculpt what they most desired, making it more and more to their liking.

Beyond the planes lie the greater mysteries of the void; and the Wise say (in furtive whispers) that only madness and chaos dwell there. For there were angels and demons too wild to be tamed even to the compass of the planes, the Varakiiri, chaos-spawn terrible beyond telling, worshippers of the night beyond night... As meteors and falling stars they once descended into the material realm, and were driven back beyond the shadows of the gates of being only at great cost, and through a long period of peril and darkness for all mortal races. Far beyond even the barren wastes beyond Imbar they raised vast citadels made of the void, fastnesses of steel and glass, and it is even said of living flesh; and they are yet at work even down to the latest days, sculpting raw planar matter into immortal labyrinths too monstrous for any mind to contemplate. Yet the wise say that within their strange habitations is a crawling chaos which will devour the world in the last battle, whose agents and acolytes often make incursions to Imbar from beyond the uttermost darkness, for in the deep places of the world, traces may still be found of the passage of the Varakiiri; and of the strange and wicked rituals they performed, many signs may be found in lesser-known places by desperate adventurers; and it is said there are nine jewels, the Kiritarun, engraved with sigils of doom, which were lost by the chaos-spawn but seek ever to recover, for their hearts are fast-bound to the jewels and they were made to bind each plane to being. It is said that were even one of the jewels to be found, the wearer could travel at the speed of thought, traverse immeasurate distances in the blink of an eye, and that innumerable wonders would be open to them...
